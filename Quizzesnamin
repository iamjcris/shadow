Java Fundamentals Quiz: Introduction to Java

1. What type of programming language is Java?
a) Low-level
b) Assembly-based
c) High-level
d) Machine-specific

Answer: c) High-level
Java is a high-level language because it abstracts complex machine instructions into human-readable code.

2. Which programming paradigm does Java follow?
a) Procedural
b) Functional
c) Object-oriented
d) Structural

Answer: c) Object-oriented
 Java is built around the concept of objects and classes, following the object-oriented programming paradigm.

3. What does WORA stand for in Java?
a) Write once, read anywhere
b) Write once, run anywhere
c) Write on random access
d) Write once, reuse always

Answer: b) Write once, run anywhere
WORA means Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of Java?
a) Platform dependent
b) Secure
c) Robust
d) Multi-threaded

Answer: a) Platform dependent
Java is platform-independent, so “platform dependent” is not one of its features.

5.In the example program, what is the name of the class?
Public class Main {
		Public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(“HelloWorld”);
}
}

a) Hello
b) HelloWorld
c) main
d) System

Answer: b) HelloWorld
The class name in the code is HelloWorld, which must match the filename.


6. What does the following line do in the Java program?

System.out.println("Hello, World!");


a) Reads input from the user
b) Prints text to the console
c) Creates a new class
d) Declares a variable

Answer: b) Prints text to the console
System.out.println() displays the specified text on the screen.

7. What keyword is used to define a class in Java?
a) def
b) function
c) class
d) public

Answer: c) class
The class keyword is used to declare or define a new class in Java.

8. What is the main purpose of the main() method in Java?
a) To store data
b) To start the execution of the program
c) To handle exceptions
d) To define variables

Answer: b) To start the execution of the program
The main() method acts as the entry point where the program begins execution.

9. Which of these features makes Java suitable for concurrent programming?
a) Platform Independence
b) Multi-threading
c) Robustness
d) Security

Answer: b) Multi-threading
Multi-threading allows Java to perform multiple tasks simultaneously in a single program.

10. Which statement best describes Java’s robustness?
a) It runs only on specific operating systems.
b) It has weak memory management.
c) It can handle errors and manage memory efficiently.
d) It does not support error handling.

Answer: c) It can handle errors and manage memory efficiently.
Java is robust because it prevents crashes through strong memory management and exception handling.

Quiz: Variables and Data Types in Java

1. Which of the following is a 64-bit integer in Java?
a) byte
b) short
c) int
d) long

2. What is the range of the byte data type in Java?
a) -128 to 127
b) -32,768 to 32,767
c) -2³¹ to 2³¹-1
d) -2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1

3. Which primitive data type is used to store a single Unicode character?
a) char
b) String
c) int
d) boolean

4. Which of the following is a floating-point data type?
a) int
b) double
c) char
d) boolean

5. Which data type can only store true or false values?
a) int
b) boolean
c) char
d) double

6. Which of the following is the correct way to declare an integer variable named age with a value of 25?
a) int age = 25;
b) age int = 25;
c) int 25 = age;
d) age = int 25;

7. What is the difference between primitive types and reference types in Java?
a) Primitive types store values directly, reference types store memory addresses
b) Primitive types store memory addresses, reference types store values directly
c) Primitive types are only for numbers, reference types are only for text
d) There is no difference

8. What is the size of a float in Java?
a) 16-bit
b) 32-bit
c) 64-bit
d) 8-bit

9. Which of these is NOT a primitive data type in Java?
a) int
b) boolean
c) String
d) byte

10. How would you declare a boolean variable named isActive with a value of true?
a) boolean isActive = true;
b) boolean = isActive true;
c) isActive boolean = true;
d) boolean isActive == true;

Answer Key & Explanations

d) long – long is a 64-bit integer in Java.

a) -128 to 127 – byte stores 8-bit integers ranging from -128 to 127.

a) char – char stores a single 16-bit Unicode character.

b) double – double is a floating-point type (64-bit); float is also floating-point (32-bit).

b) boolean – boolean can only store true or false.

a) int age = 25; – Correct syntax for declaring an integer variable in Java.

a) Primitive types store values directly, reference types store memory addresses – Primitive types contain actual data; reference types point to objects in memory.

b) 32-bit – float is a 32-bit floating-point number.

c) String – String is a reference type, not primitive.

a) boolean isActive = true; – Correct syntax for declaring a boolean variable in Java.
